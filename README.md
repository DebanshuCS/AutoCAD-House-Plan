# 🏠 AutoCAD House Plan

This project showcases a basic 2D architectural floor plan created using **Autodesk AutoCAD** as part of my learning journey in the **3D CAD Application** course on **Coursera**.

## 📌 Overview

As a component of my coursework and practical exploration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), I designed a miniature house plan with standard layout elements including:

- Living Room
- Bedrooms
- Kitchen
- Bathroom
- Main entrance and hallway

All drawing was done using AutoCAD's standard drawing tools, layers, dimensions, and annotations.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `House_Plan.dwg` – Final AutoCAD drawing file
- `House_Plan.pdf` – Exported design in printable format
- `Reference_Image.png` – Visual reference used during design
- Screenshots of design interface and plan

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- [Autodesk AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/)
- Digital drafting and precision alignment
- Layers, Polylines, Hatch, Text, and Dimension tools

## 📖 Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand the foundational concepts of 2D CAD modeling and architectural layout planning. It strengthened my ability to work with precision tools and reinforced structured design workflows that are also useful in software and UI design.
